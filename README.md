# Pokemon-Battle-Simulator
A command line application to simulate a turn-based Pokemon battle.
Developed by Zach Kiser and Adam Kolafa from 3/27/22 - 2/28/22 for the UVA HooHacks Hackathon.

The battle simulator can be run from the command line by compliling and running GameDriver.
GameDriver.java creates instances of the Pokemon class and uses the PokemonUtil class to display images of Pokemon.
